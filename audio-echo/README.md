# Audio-Echo

The sample demos how to use OpenSL ES to create a player and recorder in Android
Fast Audio Path, and connect them to loopback audio. On most android devices,
there is a optimized audio path that is tuned up for low latency purpose. The
sample creates player/recorder to work in this highly optimized audio
path(sometimes called native audio path,
[low latency path](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14842803/low-latency-audio-playback-on-android?rq=1),
or fast audio path).

***Note that OpenSL ES is
[deprecated from Android 11](https://developer.android.com/preview/features#deprecate-opensl),
developers are recommended to use [Oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe) library
instead.***

## Usage

App will capture audio from android devices and playback on the same device; the
playback on speaker will be captured immediately and played back...! So to
verify it, it is recommended to "mute" the playback audio with a
earspeaker/earphone/earbug so it does not get looped back. Some device like
Nexus 9, once you plug in an external headphone/headspeaker, it stops to use
onboard microphone AND speaker anymore -- in this case, you need turn on the
microphone coming with your headphone. Another point, when switching between
external headphone and internal one, the volume is sometimes very low/muted;
recommend to increase the playback volume with volume buttons on the phone/pad
after plugging external headphone.

## Low Latency Verification

1. execute "adb shell dumpsys media.audio_flinger". Find a list of the running
   processes

   Name Active Client Type Fmt Chn mask Session fCount S F SRate L dB R dB
   Server Main buf Aux Buf Flags UndFrmCnt\
   F 2 no 704 1 00000001 00000003 562
   13248 S 1 48000 -inf -inf 000033C0 0xabab8480 0x0 0x600 0\
   F 6 yes 9345 3
   00000001 00000001 576 128 A 1 48000 0 0 0376AA00 0xabab8480 0x0 0x400 256

1. execute adb shell ps | grep echo

- find the sample app pid
- check with result on step 1.\
  if there is one "F" in the front of your echo
  pid, **player** is on fast audio path\
  For fast audio capture \[it is totally
  different story\], if you do **NOT** see\
  com.example.nativeaudio
  W/AudioRecordï¹• AUDIO_INPUT_FLAG_FAST denied by client\
  in your logcat output
  when you are creating audio recorder, you could "assume" you are on the fast
  path.\
  If your system image was built with muted ALOGW, you will not be able
  to see the above warning message.

## Tune-ups

A couple of knobs in the code for lower latency purpose:

- audio buffer size
- number of audio buffers cached before kicking start player The lower you go
  with them, the lower latency you get and also the lower budget for audio
  processing. All audio processing has to be completed in the time period they
  are captured / played back, plus extra time needed for:
- audio driver
- audio flinger framework,
- bufferqueue callbacks etc Besides those, the irregularity of the buffer queue
  player/capture callback time is another factor. The callback from openSL may
  not as regular as you assumed, the more irregularity it is, the more likely
  have choopy audio. To fight that, more buffering is needed, which defeats the
  low-latency purpose! The low latency path is highly tuned up so you have
  better chance to get more regular callbacks. You may experiment with your
  platform to find the best parameters for lower latency and continuously
  playback audio experience. The app capture and playback on the same device
  \[most of times the same chip\], capture and playback clocks are assumed
  synchronized naturally \[so we are not dealing with it\]
